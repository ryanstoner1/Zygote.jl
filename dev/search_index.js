With Zygote you can write down any Julia code you feel like – including using existing Julia packages – then get gradients and optimise your program. Deep learning, ML and probabilistic programming are all different kinds of differentiable programming that you can do with Zygote.At least, that\'s the idea. We\'re still in beta so expect some adventures."

    "text": "These notebooks and the Zygote paper provide useful background on Zygote\'s transform; this page is particularly focused on implementation details.Given a function likefunction foo(x)\n  a = bar(x)\n  b = baz(a)\n  return b\nendhow do we differentiate it? The key is that we can differentiate foo if we can differentiate bar and baz. If we assume we can get pullbacks for those functions, the pullback for foo looks as follows.function J(::typeof(foo), x)\n  a, da = J(bar, x)\n  b, db = J(baz, a)\n  return b, function(b̄)\n    ā = db(b̄)\n    x̄ = da(ā)\n    return x̄\n  end\nendThus, where the forward pass calculates x -> a -> b, the backwards takes b̄ -> ā -> x̄ via the pullbacks. The AD transform is recursive; we\'ll differentiate bar and baz in the same way, until we hit a case where gradient is explicitly defined.Here\'s a working example that illustrates the concepts.J(::typeof(sin), x) = sin(x), ȳ -> ȳ*cos(x)\nJ(::typeof(cos), x) = cos(x), ȳ -> -ȳ*sin(x)\n\nfoo(x) = sin(cos(x))\n\nfunction J(::typeof(foo), x)\n  a, da = J(sin, x)\n  b, db = J(cos, a)\n  return b, function(b̄)\n    ā = db(b̄)\n    x̄ = da(ā)\n    return x̄\n  end\nend\n\ngradient(f, x) = J(f, x)[2](1)\n\ngradient(foo, 1)Now, clearly this is a mechanical transformation, so the only remaining thing is to automate it – a small matter of programming."

    "text": "We could do this transform with a macro, but don\'t want to require that all differentiable code is annotated. Instead a generated function gets us much of the power of a macro without this annotation, because we can use it to get lowered code for a function. We can then modify the code as we please and return it to implement J(foo, x).julia> foo(x) = baz(bar(x))\nfoo (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> @code_lowered foo(1)\nCodeInfo(\n1 ─ %1 = (Main.bar)(x)\n│   %2 = (Main.baz)(%1)\n└──      return %2We convert the code to SSA form using Julia\'s built-in IR data structure, after which it looks like this.julia> Zygote.@code_ir foo(1)\n1 1 ─ %1 = (Main.bar)(_2)::Any\n  │   %2 = (Main.baz)(%1)::Any\n  └──      return %2    (There isn\'t much difference unless there\'s some control flow.)The code is then differentiated by the code in compiler/reverse.jl. You can see the output with @code_adjoint.julia> Zygote.@code_adjoint foo(1)\n1 1 ─ %1  = (Zygote._forward)(_2, Zygote.unwrap, Main.bar)::Any\n  │   %2  = (Base.getindex)(%1, 1)::Any\n  │         (Base.getindex)(%1, 2)::Any\n  │   %4  = (Zygote._forward)(_2, %2, _4)::Any\n  │   %5  = (Base.getindex)(%4, 1)::Any\n  │         (Base.getindex)(%4, 2)::Any\n  │   %7  = (Zygote._forward)(_2, Zygote.unwrap, Main.baz)::Any\n  │   %8  = (Base.getindex)(%7, 1)::Any\n  │         (Base.getindex)(%7, 2)::Any\n  │   %10 = (Zygote._forward)(_2, %8, %5)::Any\n  │   %11 = (Base.getindex)(%10, 1)::Any\n  │         (Base.getindex)(%10, 2)::Any\n  └──       return %11\n  1 ─ %1  = Δ()::Any\n1 │   %2  = (@12)(%1)::Any\n  │   %3  = (Zygote.gradindex)(%2, 1)::Any\n  │   %4  = (Zygote.gradindex)(%2, 2)::Any\n  │         (@9)(%3)::Any\n  │   %6  = (@6)(%4)::Any\n  │   %7  = (Zygote.gradindex)(%6, 1)::Any\n  │   %8  = (Zygote.gradindex)(%6, 2)::Any\n  │         (@3)(%7)::Any\n  │   %10 = (Zygote.tuple)(nothing, %8)::Any\n  └──       return %10\n, [1])This code is quite verbose, mainly due to all the tuple unpacking (gradindex is just like getindex, but handles nothing gracefully). The are two pieces of IR here, one for the modified forward pass and one for the pullback closure. The @ nodes allow the closure to refer to values from the forward pass, and the Δ() represents the incoming gradient ȳ. In essence, this is just what we wrote above by hand for J(::typeof(foo), x).compiler/emit.jl lowers this code into runnable IR (e.g. by turning @ references into getfields and stacks), and it\'s then turned back into lowered code for Julia to run."

    "text": "There are no closures in lowered Julia code, so we can\'t actually emit one directly in lowered code. To work around this we have a trick: we have a generic struct likestruct Pullback{F}\n  data\nendWe can put whatever we want in data, and the F will be the signature for the original call, like Tuple{typeof(foo),Int}. When the pullback gets called it hits another generated function which emits the pullback code.In hand written code this would look like:struct Pullback{F}\n  data\nend\n\nfunction J(::typeof(foo), x)\n  a, da = J(sin, x)\n  b, db = J(cos, a)\n  return b, Pullback{typeof(foo)}((da, db))\nend\n\nfunction(p::Pullback{typeof(foo)})(b̄)\n  da, db = p.data[1], p.data[2]\n  ā = db(b̄)\n  x̄ = da(ā)\n  return x̄\nend"
